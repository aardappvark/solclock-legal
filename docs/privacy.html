<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<span class="updated">Effective date: 13 February 2025 · Last updated: 13 February 2025 · Version 1.0</span>

<div class="callout">
  <strong>Summary:</strong> Sol Clock stores all data locally on your device. We do not operate servers, collect personal information, or track your behaviour. The only network requests are read-only API calls to fetch publicly available price and blockchain data.
</div>

<h2>1. Data Controller</h2>
<p>Sol Clock is developed and maintained by an independent developer operating under Australian law.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Entity:</strong> Sol Clock (sole proprietor)</li>
  <li><strong>Jurisdiction:</strong> Australia</li>
  <li><strong>Privacy contact:</strong> <a href="mailto:aardappvark@proton.me">aardappvark@proton.me</a></li>
  <li><strong>Package name:</strong> <code>com.solclock.app</code></li>
</ul>
<p>For the purposes of the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and UK General Data Protection Regulation (UK GDPR), the data controller is the developer identified above. If you are located in the European Economic Area (EEA) or United Kingdom and have questions about data protection, please contact us at the email address above.</p>

<h2>2. What Data Sol Clock Collects</h2>
<p>Sol Clock is designed with a <strong>privacy-first, local-only architecture</strong>. All data remains exclusively on your device in app-private storage (Android SharedPreferences and EncryptedSharedPreferences). No data is transmitted to any server we operate, because we do not operate any servers.</p>

<h3>2.1 Data stored locally on your device</h3>
<table>
  <tr><th>Data type</th><th>Purpose</th><th>Legal basis (GDPR)</th></tr>
  <tr><td>Wallet public address</td><td>Display balance on clock face (opt-in)</td><td>Consent (Art. 6(1)(a))</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Wallet app name</td><td>Show which wallet was used to sign in</td><td>Consent (Art. 6(1)(a))</td></tr>
  <tr><td>SGT status &amp; member number</td><td>Display Seeker Genesis Token verification</td><td>Consent (Art. 6(1)(a))</td></tr>
  <tr><td>App preferences</td><td>Clock display settings, world clock cities, themes</td><td>Contract (Art. 6(1)(b))</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Engagement data</td><td>Streak counts and daily interaction counters</td><td>Contract (Art. 6(1)(b))</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Device timezone</td><td>Display local time and location label</td><td>Contract (Art. 6(1)(b))</td></tr>
</table>

<h3>2.2 Coarse location (ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION)</h3>
<p>Sol Clock requests Android coarse location permission <strong>solely for regulatory compliance</strong> — specifically to detect whether the device is located in a jurisdiction subject to international sanctions. This permission:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Is used <strong>only at app startup</strong> for sanctions screening</li>
  <li>Returns approximate location (network-based, not GPS)</li>
  <li>Is <strong>not stored</strong>, <strong>not logged</strong>, and <strong>not transmitted</strong> to any server</li>
  <li>Is processed entirely on-device using Android Geocoder</li>
  <li>Can be denied — the app will fall back to SIM card and network carrier country detection</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Legal basis (GDPR):</strong> Legitimate interest (Art. 6(1)(f)) — compliance with international sanctions law. We have conducted a balancing test and determined that the compelling legal obligation to screen for sanctioned regions outweighs the minimal privacy intrusion of a single on-device coarse location check that is never stored or transmitted.</p>

<h3>2.3 Data we do NOT collect</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Names, email addresses, phone numbers, or any personally identifiable information (PII)</li>
  <li>Private keys, seed phrases, wallet credentials, or passwords</li>
  <li>Device identifiers, Android Advertising ID, or hardware serial numbers</li>
  <li>Precise GPS location data</li>
  <li>Usage analytics, behavioural tracking, or session data</li>
  <li>Cookies, browser history, or web tracking data</li>
  <li>Biometric data</li>
  <li>Health, financial (beyond read-only public blockchain balance), or demographic data</li>
  <li>Contact lists, call logs, SMS, camera, or microphone data</li>
</ul>

<h2>3. No Server-Side Data Storage</h2>
<p>Sol Clock does <strong>not</strong> operate any backend servers, databases, cloud storage, or analytics infrastructure. We have no server-side systems capable of receiving, storing, or processing user data. All data exists exclusively in your device's app-private storage and is inaccessible to other applications.</p>

<h2>4. Third-Party API Calls</h2>
<p>Sol Clock makes <strong>read-only</strong> API requests to the following third-party services to retrieve publicly available data. These requests are HTTPS-encrypted and no user-specific data is included in the requests except where noted:</p>

<table>
  <tr><th>Service</th><th>Endpoint</th><th>Data retrieved</th><th>User data sent</th></tr>
  <tr><td>Jupiter API</td><td>lite-api.jup.ag</td><td>SOL and SKR token prices</td><td>None</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Raydium API</td><td>api-v3.raydium.io</td><td>SOL and SKR token prices (fallback)</td><td>None</td></tr>
  <tr><td>CoinGecko API</td><td>api.coingecko.com</td><td>Prices and 24-hour change data (fallback)</td><td>None</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Solana RPC</td><td>api.mainnet-beta.solana.com</td><td>Blockchain slot height; wallet SOL balance</td><td>Wallet public address*</td></tr>
</table>

<p>* Your Solana wallet public address is sent to the Solana RPC endpoint <strong>only when you have opted in</strong> by signing in with your wallet. Wallet public addresses are publicly visible on the Solana blockchain and are not generally considered personal information, though GDPR may classify pseudonymous identifiers as personal data. The legal basis for this processing is your explicit consent (Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR).</p>

<div class="callout callout-green">
  <strong>Note on IP addresses:</strong> When Sol Clock makes HTTP requests to the above APIs, your device's IP address is inherently transmitted as part of the network protocol. This is standard for all internet-connected applications. We do not control how these third-party services handle IP addresses — please refer to their respective privacy policies.
</div>

<h2>5. Mobile Wallet Adapter (MWA)</h2>
<p>Wallet sign-in uses Solana's Mobile Wallet Adapter protocol, which operates <strong>entirely locally</strong> between Sol Clock and your wallet app on the same device via Android inter-process communication. During the MWA sign-in process:</p>
<ul>
  <li>No data leaves your device</li>
  <li>Your private keys remain exclusively within your wallet app</li>
  <li>Sol Clock receives only your wallet's public address and wallet name</li>
  <li>The sign-in can be revoked at any time by disconnecting in Settings</li>
</ul>

<h2>6. Data Security</h2>
<p>We implement the following security measures to protect locally stored data:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Encryption at rest:</strong> Wallet-related data (public address, wallet name, SGT status) is stored using Android <code>EncryptedSharedPreferences</code> with AES-256-SIV encryption (via Google Tink)</li>
  <li><strong>Encryption in transit:</strong> All network communications use HTTPS/TLS encryption</li>
  <li><strong>App-private storage:</strong> All SharedPreferences files are stored in the app's private directory, inaccessible to other apps on non-rooted devices</li>
  <li><strong>No remote attack surface:</strong> With no server infrastructure, there is no server-side data to breach</li>
</ul>

<h2>7. Data Retention and Deletion</h2>
<p>All data is stored locally on your device and is retained until you explicitly delete it. You can delete all Sol Clock data at any time by:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Disconnecting your wallet:</strong> Settings → Wallet → Disconnect (clears wallet-related data)</li>
  <li><strong>Clearing app data:</strong> Android Settings → Apps → Sol Clock → Storage → Clear Data (clears all preferences)</li>
  <li><strong>Uninstalling the app:</strong> Removes all Sol Clock data from your device</li>
</ul>
<p>Since no data is stored on our servers, deletion from your device constitutes complete deletion.</p>

<h2>8. International Data Transfers</h2>
<p>Sol Clock does not transfer personal data to our servers (we have none). However, when Sol Clock makes API calls to third-party services (see Section 4), network requests may be routed through servers located outside your country of residence, including servers in the United States.</p>
<p>For users in the EEA or UK: these API calls are limited to fetching publicly available price data and, where you have consented, querying your wallet's public balance. We rely on the derogation under Article 49(1)(a) GDPR (explicit consent for wallet balance queries) and Article 49(1)(c) (necessary for the performance of the contract for price data retrieval).</p>

<h2>9. Your Rights</h2>

<h3>9.1 European Economic Area &amp; United Kingdom (GDPR / UK GDPR)</h3>

<h2>10. Children's Privacy</h2>
<p>Sol Clock is not directed at, marketed to, or intended for use by children under the age of 16 (or 13 in jurisdictions where that threshold applies, including the United States under COPPA). We do not knowingly collect any information from children. If you believe a child has provided data to the app, the data exists only on that child's device and can be removed by clearing app data or uninstalling the app.</p>

<h2>11. Automated Decision-Making</h2>
<p>Sol Clock performs one automated decision: <strong>sanctions region screening</strong> at app startup. If your device is detected in a sanctioned jurisdiction, the app displays an informational screen explaining the restriction. This automated decision is based on legitimate interest in regulatory compliance (GDPR Art. 22(2)(b)) and does not produce legal effects beyond restricting access to the app's informational features. You may contact us to contest this decision.</p>

<h2>12. Data Protection Impact Assessment</h2>
<p>We have conducted an internal assessment of our data processing activities and determined that a formal Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) under GDPR Art. 35 is not required because:</p>
<ul>
  <li>We do not engage in large-scale processing of personal data</li>
  <li>We do not systematically monitor public areas</li>
  <li>We do not process special categories of data</li>
  <li>Location data is processed on-device only and never stored or transmitted</li>
</ul>

<h2>13. Do Not Track</h2>
<p>Sol Clock does not track users in any way and therefore inherently honours Do Not Track (DNT) signals. There is no tracking to disable.</p>

<h2>14. Local Storage Disclosure (ePrivacy)</h2>
<p>For the purposes of the EU ePrivacy Directive (2002/58/EC) and its national implementations: Sol Clock stores configuration data on your device using Android SharedPreferences and EncryptedSharedPreferences. This storage is <strong>strictly necessary</strong> for the functioning of the application (exempted from consent requirements under Art. 5(3)) and does not involve any tracking, profiling, or advertising functionality.</p>

<h2>15. Changes to This Policy</h2>
<p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. When we make material changes, we will:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Update the "Last updated" date at the top of this page</li>
  <li>Update the version number</li>
  <li>Make the new version available within the app and at this URL</li>
</ul>
<p>Continued use of Sol Clock after changes take effect constitutes acceptance of the updated policy. We encourage you to review this policy periodically.</p>

<h2>16. Contact</h2>
<p>For any privacy-related questions, concerns, or to exercise your data subject rights, please contact:</p>

<h2>17. Governing Law</h2>
<p>This Privacy Policy is governed by the laws of Australia, without regard to conflict of law principles. This does not affect your statutory rights under the laws of your country of residence, including rights under GDPR (for EEA/UK residents), CCPA/CPRA (for California residents), or other applicable local privacy laws.</p>
