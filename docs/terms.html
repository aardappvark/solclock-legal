<h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>

<p>We may update these Terms from time to time. Continued use of the App after the posting of revised Terms constitutes your acceptance of the updated Terms. We will update the "Last updated" date at the top of this page when material changes are made.</p>

</ul>
<p>The App functions as a <strong>read-only information display tool</strong>. It does not and cannot execute financial transactions, swap tokens, transfer funds, manage portfolios, or provide financial advisory services of any kind.</p>

<h2>3. Eligibility</h2>
<p>You must be at least 18 years of age (or the age of majority in your jurisdiction, whichever is higher) to use this App. By using the App, you represent and warrant that:</p>
<ul>
  <li>You are at least 18 years old or have reached the age of majority in your jurisdiction</li>
  <li>You are not located in, a resident of, or a national of any jurisdiction subject to comprehensive international sanctions (see our <a href="sanctions.html">Sanctions &amp; Restricted Regions Policy</a>)</li>
  <li>You are not listed on any applicable sanctions list, including but not limited to the US OFAC Specially Designated Nationals (SDN) List, EU Consolidated Sanctions List, UK OFSI Consolidated List, or Australian DFAT Consolidated List</li>
  <li>You are not acting on behalf of any sanctioned entity or person</li>
  <li>Your use of the App complies with all applicable laws in your jurisdiction</li>
</ul>

<h2>4. Not Financial Advice — Entertainment Purposes Only</h2>
<div class="callout">
  <strong>CRITICAL DISCLAIMER:</strong> All cryptocurrency price data, market data, blockchain data, token balance information, and any other financial information displayed by Sol Clock is provided strictly for entertainment, informational, and novelty purposes only. None of this information constitutes financial advice, investment advice, trading advice, or any other form of professional advice.
</div>
<p>You expressly acknowledge, understand, and agree that:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Price data may be delayed, inaccurate, incomplete, stale, or entirely unavailable at any time</li>
  <li>The App does not provide financial advice, investment recommendations, trading signals, or buy/sell/hold suggestions</li>
  <li>You must not rely on any data displayed by the App for investment, trading, financial, or any other decisions with financial consequences</li>
  <li>You should always consult qualified, licensed financial advisors in your jurisdiction before making any investment or financial decisions</li>
  <li>The developer is not a licensed financial advisor, broker, dealer, investment advisor, or fiduciary</li>
  <li>The App is not registered with or regulated by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC), the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), the UK Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), the Japan Financial Services Agency (FSA), or any other financial regulatory authority in any jurisdiction</li>
  <li>The App does not require such registration because it does not provide financial services</li>
  <li>Cryptocurrency markets are highly volatile and speculative; past performance is not indicative of future results</li>
  <li>You assume all risk for any financial decisions you make, regardless of whether you viewed data in this App</li>
</ul>

<h2>5. Wallet Integration</h2>
<p>Sol Clock uses Solana's Mobile Wallet Adapter (MWA) protocol for optional wallet sign-in. By connecting your wallet, you acknowledge and agree that:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Sol Clock communicates with your wallet app <strong>locally on your device</strong> — no data is sent to external servers during the sign-in process</li>
  <li>Sol Clock receives only your wallet's <strong>public address</strong> and wallet app name</li>
  <li>Sol Clock <strong>never</strong> has access to your private keys, seed phrases, mnemonic phrases, or wallet passwords</li>
  <li>Sol Clock <strong>cannot</strong> initiate, sign, or execute any blockchain transactions</li>
  <li>The wallet balance displayed is retrieved from the public Solana blockchain and may be delayed or inaccurate</li>
  <li>You are solely responsible for the security of your wallet, private keys, and all associated assets</li>
  <li>You may disconnect your wallet at any time via the App's Settings screen</li>
</ul>

<h2>6. Seeker Genesis Token (SGT) Verification</h2>
<p>The App can check whether a connected wallet holds a Seeker Genesis Token. This feature:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Is purely informational — it verifies on-chain token ownership status</li>
  <li>Makes no representation about the value, utility, investment potential, or future prospects of SGTs</li>
  <li>Relies on on-chain data which may have propagation delays or temporary inconsistencies</li>
  <li>Should not be relied upon as the sole method of verifying SGT ownership for any consequential purpose</li>
</ul>

<h2>7. Third-Party Services and Data Sources</h2>
<p>Sol Clock retrieves data from third-party APIs including Jupiter, Raydium, CoinGecko, and Solana RPC endpoints. You acknowledge that:</p>
<ul>
  <li>We are not responsible for the availability, accuracy, reliability, or timeliness of third-party services</li>
  <li>Third-party services may experience downtime, rate limiting, data errors, or discontinuation without notice</li>
  <li>These services are governed by their own terms of service and privacy policies</li>
  <li>We do not guarantee that any particular data source will remain available</li>
  <li>Data may differ between sources and between the App and other platforms displaying similar data</li>
</ul>
