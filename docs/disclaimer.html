By using Sol Clock, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to this Disclaimer and Risk Disclosure.
</div>

<h2>1. General Disclaimer</h2>
<p>Sol Clock is an analogue clock and information display application for the Solana Seeker phone. All cryptocurrency price data, market data, blockchain data, wallet balance information, token ownership data, and any other information displayed by Sol Clock (collectively, "Displayed Information") is provided <strong>strictly for entertainment, informational, and novelty purposes only</strong>.</p>
<p>The Displayed Information does not constitute, and must not be construed as:</p>

<p>The App does not require such registration or licensing because it is an information display tool that does not provide financial services, facilitate transactions, hold custody of assets, or provide financial advice.</p>

<h2>3. Price Data Accuracy Disclaimer</h2>
<p>Cryptocurrency price data displayed by Sol Clock is sourced from third-party APIs (Jupiter, Raydium, CoinGecko) and:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>May be delayed</strong> — Prices are fetched at configurable intervals (30 seconds to 5 minutes) and may not reflect the most current market price</li>
  <li><strong>May be inaccurate</strong> — Third-party data sources may provide incorrect data due to API errors, calculation errors, or data feed issues</li>
  <li><strong>May be incomplete</strong> — Not all data fields may be available at all times</li>
  <li><strong>May be entirely unavailable</strong> — API services may experience downtime, rate limiting, or discontinuation</li>
  <li><strong>May differ from other sources</strong> — Prices on different exchanges and data providers may vary due to liquidity differences, time zone differences, and market microstructure</li>
  <li><strong>Are not audited or verified</strong> — We do not independently verify the accuracy of data from our sources</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Under no circumstances should you rely on prices displayed by Sol Clock for trading, investment, or any financial decisions.</strong></p>

<h2>4. Cryptocurrency Risk Acknowledgement</h2>
<p>By using Sol Clock, you acknowledge that you understand and accept the following risks inherent in cryptocurrency markets:</p>

<h3>4.1 Market volatility</h3>
<p>Cryptocurrency markets are extremely volatile. Prices can and do fluctuate dramatically within very short periods. Past performance of any cryptocurrency, including SOL and SKR, is not indicative of future performance.</p>

<h3>4.2 Regulatory risk</h3>
<p>Cryptocurrency regulation varies significantly by jurisdiction and is rapidly evolving. Changes in law or regulation could materially affect the value, transferability, or legality of cryptocurrency tokens.</p>

<h3>4.3 Technology risk</h3>
<p>Blockchain networks, including Solana, may experience technical failures, congestion, halts, exploits, or other issues that could affect token values or accessibility.</p>

<h3>4.4 Total loss risk</h3>
<p>The value of any cryptocurrency, including SOL and SKR, may decline to zero. You could lose the entire value of your holdings.</p>

<h3>4.5 Liquidity risk</h3>
<p>There is no guarantee of sufficient market liquidity for any cryptocurrency token at any given time.</p>

<h2>5. No Custody, No Transactions</h2>
<p>Sol Clock:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Does <strong>not</strong> hold, store, custody, or manage any cryptocurrency, tokens, digital assets, or funds</li>

<p>The SGT ownership verification feature in Sol Clock:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Is provided for informational purposes only</li>
  <li>Makes no representation about the value, utility, future prospects, or investment potential of Seeker Genesis Tokens</li>

</ul>

<h2>7. Wallet Balance Disclaimer</h2>
<p>Wallet balances displayed by Sol Clock are queried from the public Solana blockchain and:</p>
<ul>
  <li>May not reflect pending transactions, uncommitted state changes, or the most recent block</li>
  <li>Are denominated in SOL and may not reflect the fiat-equivalent value at the time of display</li>
  <li>May be temporarily inaccurate during periods of network congestion or RPC node issues</li>
  <li>Should not be relied upon for accounting, tax reporting, or financial record-keeping purposes</li>
</ul>

<h2>8. Slot Height Disclaimer</h2>
<p>Solana slot height data is provided for informational and novelty purposes. The displayed slot number may lag behind the actual blockchain tip due to RPC node propagation delays and should not be relied upon for time-sensitive blockchain operations.</p>

<h2>9. No Recommendation or Endorsement</h2>
<p>The display of SOL, SKR, or any other token data in Sol Clock does not constitute a recommendation, endorsement, or promotion of any cryptocurrency, blockchain network, exchange, or project. Token inclusion in the App is based solely on relevance to the Solana Seeker ecosystem.</p>
